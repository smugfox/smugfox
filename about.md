Born and raised in San Francisco, I’ve been honing my craft for a little over a year now. In that time, I’ve attended Cloud Computing Academy, and interned for a small tech company called GoodMojo, where I focused primarily on refactoring HTML and CSS for their intranet applications.

Every day I try and learn something new within the fields of Web Design, Web Development and UI Design. Anything that can help make me a more well rounded individual living in the Wild west of mobile and web design.

When I’m not playing around in Sketch, you’ll find me running 10+ miles every other day or cooking heart healthy meals like BLT’s and homemade bolognese sauce.
