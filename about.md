Born and raised in San Francisco, I've been honing my craft for a little over a year now.  In that time, I've attended Cloud Computing Academy, and interned for a small startup called GoodMojo.  Where I focused primarily on refactoring HTML and CSS for their intranet applications.

Every day I try and learn something new within the fields of Web Design, Web Development and UI Design.  Anything that can help make me a more well rounded individual living in the Wild Wild West known as frontend and frontend design.

When I'm not playing around with CSS, you'll find me running 10+ miles every other day or cooking heart healthy meals like BLT's and homemade bolognese sauce.
