## Rise Up!

I love Street Fighter, always have, always will.  It's amazing how much of an impact the Capcom fighting game has had on me, and millions of other gamers from around the world.  So with the release of Street Fighter V just a few days ago, and my discovery of a wonderful piece of software called [Principle](http://principleformac.com/), I wanted to see if I could make some kind of cool UI prototype.

There are a ton of prototype applications out right now, and to be honest, it's kind of overwhelming to try and learn the right one, because who knows which one is going to become "_the one_" that everyone uses.  So with that in mind, I dived head first into Principle, and found some really neat prototypes on dribbble, and also Principles [Facebook community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/752853024840625/).

My idea for the small app was something that celebrates the history of Street Fighter, and also functions as a call to action to Capcom's upcoming line of Street Fighter merchandise celebrating Street Fighter V.
