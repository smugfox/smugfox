## GiantBomb App Idea

<p class="invision__p">One of my favorite sites for years has been <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com">GiantBomb</a>.  Their videos never cease to put a smile on my face, and their wacky antics always have me laughing.  So for my next project, I wanted to take a stab at designing a GiantBomb app.  The challenge for me was to try and create the same experience that users of the site get, and somehow shrink it down to the bare essentials, while still retaining the look and feel of the GiantBomb brand.</p>
<p class="invision__p">So after reviewing the website, and jotting down a bunch of notes, I went and made a few paper prototypes of what the UI may look like.  I wanted to have five tabs, them being videos, forums, news, podcasts, and the GiantBomb wiki.  I want to make sure that the whole design of the app has a continuity to it, and therefore when I go ahead and design my screens, I have to keep that value in mind.</p>
<p class="invision__p">Have a gander at my Marvel prototype, and below that my notes and amazing drawing skills!</p>
