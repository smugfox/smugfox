## The latest and freshest kicks for sale!

Looking at the latest in sneaker wear has been a hobby of mine for quite some time now.  Seeing what crazy cool color ways or patterns that designers use to express themselves through the sneaker medium has always helped me in getting my creative juices flowing.  So I thought I would go and try to make a very quick and simple __Sneakerhead__ app.

When a user opened the sneakers app, they would be greeted with the latest four shoes that had been added, they could cycle through them, click on ones that interested them, or skip them and be taken to the catalog area.

My whole idea for the sneaker app was an app that would show off a handful of brand new Nike sneakers for sale.  This app could have easily become unmanageable if I added more brands of sneakers besides Nike, and limiting myself to ten sneakers instead of a hundred helps focus the attention on just what's available, and not an endless stream of sneakers that may or may not be available for purchase.  While viewing the catalog, I didn't want to display the names of the sneakers, just the two color ways so a user could instantly see the two varying colors, without having to click the item to see if there are more than one type of color way.

I wanted to make purchasing sneakers a breeze with large inputs so that users could buy the right size, color and quantity in as few steps needed.  Any size not available will be easily noticed with greyed out boxes with a diagonal line through the size number.

Finally the shopping cart is a simple stacked item view where a user can easily add, remove, edit, or purchase their sneakers.  If a user swipes an item to the left, they can remove that item, and if they swipe an item to the right, they can edit that shoe items color, size and quantity.

Like I said before, this was just a very simple sneaker app idea that I had.  There are a ton of things that I would like to do to improve this idea, such as adding more sneaker brands besides Nike, and UI changes that I'm not happy with.  For now though, I'm going to try and prototype this in [Principle](http://principleformac.com/) to see just how this app flows.  Below are some of my art boards for the sneaker app.
