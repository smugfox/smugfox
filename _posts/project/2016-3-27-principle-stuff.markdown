## A Bunch of Principle Prototypes

Out of all the prototyping software that I've tried out, I seem to have gravitated towards Principle.  It just seems to make sense in my reptilian brain.  So for the past month or so, I've made a bunch of animations in Principle that I deem "okay" for posting here.  I must admit that I download a lot of other peoples .prd files, and try to figure out how they make their prototypes, so a few prototypes are based off other peoples amazing work.  So without further adieu, here are a few animations that I've made using Principle.


This first animation was done after I downloaded someone's .prd file that showcased a "pop" animation on a button press.  I thought that it was a pretty cool looking effect, and so I tried to re-create it.  The lines aren't really even, but that's more because Principle doesn't have a great way of positioning elements diagonally perfectly with other diagonal elements.

The elastic paging animation was a real simple animation to make, and it's also a really neat effect.

I was reading a Medium post someone made on Principle, and they had this little smiling dude moving in a paging animation.  I thought that it looked really adorable, and wanted to see if I could re-create it.  I think I nailed it pretty well.

Ah yes, the "Hamburger" navbar element.  Many hate it, others love it, I tend to be somewhere in the middle leaning on the hate side.  Nonetheless, I saw a cool animation on some guys Dribbble post, and wanted to see if I could re-make it in Principle.  Turns out you can, and it only requires three squares to work.  The middle rectangle turns into a circle in the next artboard to make the neat effect.

Invision made a blog post on how they make GIFs for some of their posts, and I really liked one of the animations that was used in the video.  So I went and made it in Principle, and this was my result.

I wanted to make some kind of "loading" animation for when you're waiting for some data to load.  This is what I came up with.  I kind of stole the idea from Street Fighter V's loading animation.

Another Dribbble post of a neat transition from search icon to actual search input.  This was pretty simple to make as well.

Someone posted on Principle's Community Facebook page a really cool sunrise animation.  I actually went and re-created that animation, but then after finishing marathoning through a bunch of Star Wars Rebels episodes, I came up with an interesting idea for a Tatooine sunset with a Sand Crawler.  It's pretty basic, but I liked how the sky changes colors, as well as the two suns.

So I was trying to figure out some fun way of purchasing a football ticket, and while the ticket is being processed, you would watch a little animation take place.  I could have really expanded on this animation, such as adding a failure to process animation.  I was also trying out a different idea of having the 49er player actually running with the football and making a touchdown, but I must admit that I think I still lack the skill to proceed with that idea.

I made this one after downloading a users .prd file from Dribbble.  I liked it so much that I went and re-made the whole thing using a National Park list that had the image zoom in slightly and fade out when reading the article.

Now this idea came straight from a fellow Principle user.  I loved it so much that I went and re-made the whole thing from scratch.  It's another purchasing animation that would play when you clicked to purchase a plane ticket.

This was just a dumb little animation that I tried out last week while looking at my Twitter feed.  Nothing too special, but I kind of like what I made.

That's it for now!  I'm sure I'll make more animations in the near future to post about.
