## Invision Prototype Overwatch App

<p class="invision__p">I went ahead and tried to envision (pun intended) what my Overwatch app would look like using Invision.  After exporting all my artboards and uploading them to a project board, I slowly went and tried to connect the dots and see if this app would work.  For the most part I'm pretty satisfied with the results.  There are a lot of improvements that I already see I could make, such as font weights and sizes, possibly changing the main yellow color to a lighter blue to represent the Blizzard identity. Too bad I didn't get into the beta so that I could poke around and look at the in game UI to see what Blizzard has done. <img alt="FeelsBadMan" title="FeelsBadMan" class="dank_emote" src="/img/emotes/dank.svg"/></p>
