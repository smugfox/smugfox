Thinking fast on your feet can be an exhilarating experience for some, but for many, it can be quite terrifying.  I would definitely stick myself in the second category.  So after reading up on what exactly a [whiteboard design](https://uxdesign.cc/designchallenge-cd7bdb589855#.18tt5l3tl) [challenge](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140710014509-51143638-the-ninja-skill-for-ux-designers-earning-your-whiteboard-belt) is, I knew that I had to practice this invaluable UX skill.  After trying it a couple of times, I can now say that I'm much more confident in not only my empathy mapping skills, but my ability to try and tackle user needs and figuring out solutions to whatever problems that they may be having.

Maybe you're asking yourself, "What the hell is the 20 minute whiteboard design challenge?"  Well, essentially it's a challenge that many people take when they're being interviewed for design positions at companies.  Particularly design positions that revolve around solving UX/UI problems.  The interviewers will give a candidate a design problem that they then have to come up with a possible solution.  Essentially what you're trying to show as a candidate is your critical thinking capabilities instead of actually coming up with a usable solution.  Your ability to empathize with a user, and find solutions to particular user needs and goals is more important to be showcasing instead of drawing up a bunch of wireframes.  If you're given a design problem, your first step shouldn't be designing wireframes.  Instead, designing personas by asking questions, finding out assumptions and constraints, as well as figuring out user needs and goals are what you should be doing first.

While performing different design challenges that I came up with, I really began to see the pros and cons of doing this exercise.  When it comes to pros, there's a lot to talk about.  Being able to think up solutions to potential problems is a great skill to have.  It not only makes you look like you're in control to clients, but it's freeing in a sense because you're able to speak and think without real consequence.  With the right group of designers, being able to bounce ideas off of, and seeing if they work well with what the users goals are is a great feeling to have.  Seeing as how you're going to be bouncing ideas off of stakeholders and other designers constantly, being comfortable with talking and listening to critiques is a skill that gets tested within these design challenges.  Therefore becoming comfortable with being critiqued and analyzed is just going to be part of the job, so making sure you know how to handle yourself in those situations is critical.

Being able to practice core UX principles when performing these 20 minute whiteboard design challenges was also a real eye opener for myself.  Visualizing user needs and goals through the use of empathy maps, personas, and user journeys really hit home just how important it is to understand what problems a user may have with the designs that you come up with.  I especially enjoyed drawing journey breaks, and trying to find out where in the user flow further design iterations could be beneficial.  Finding user pain points from talking to users and building personas is another great skill that's used during these design challenges.

There are a couple of cons that I felt during practicing the 20 minute whiteboard design challenge.  First of all, you aren't supposed to be doing these by yourself.  However, being self taught, I didn't have anyone to help practice these challenges with.  So while I did try my best at making it feel like a real design challenge, I know that it wasn't the greatest way to be practicing my skill set.  Another con that I see is that 20 minutes isn't a lot of time to come up with a great solution to the problem.  Like I said earlier, you're not being tested to see if you come up with a working solution, but it's more about the steps that you take to come up with said solution.  Still, the time constraint was a bit much for me to feel like I was doing a good job.  The last con is more of a personal one for me, and it's about retaining information quickly.  For me, suffering from dyslexia, I have a hard time retaining lots of information quickly, while also writing it out on a whiteboard.  For most, this may be really simple to do, but I know that I will struggle with it forever.  Hopefully it isn't a deal breaker for companies that I want to work for, but only time will tell.

Being a self taught UX/UI designer has been a real learning experience.  This design challenge was no exception, and so while performing different whiteboard design challenges, I learned a whole lot about my critical thinking process, as well as really trying to put myself in a users shoes.  I think that's the biggest take away from practicing these challenges.  I really don't like the word empathy, because as [Jonas Downey](https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-art-of-designing-with-heart-f5dc4df21697#.ql25vn4bg) said, really what you're doing is designing with heart.  I want to study the problems that users are having, and figuring out through personas, journey breaks, and empathy maps a possible design solution that may help users at their job.  Therefore making sure that I felt empathy while performing these design challenges is what I really tried to do.  I wanted to make sure that even though these design challenges were made up, I was still designing with heart, and putting myself in my users shoes to come up with a possible solution.
