## You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)

While browsing Dribbble a couple of days ago, I stumbled upon [Alex Prokhoda's](https://dribbble.com/shots/2602525-Music-Player-Exploration) teams "musical exploration journey" post.  I really loved their UI design for a music player, so I saved the GIF, and re-made the entire UI and prototype in Principle.  I think their idea of having the vinyl record and its record cover interact when you skip to the next song really neat and different.  I especially like the idea of having the record spin while the song plays.  The UI is very basic, but I think that plays well with the idea of it being a shuffle section, and not a full album section where you would have an artist description and the rest of the songs in that album.      

I studied the GIF for a while and tried to break down just what Alex's team pulled off in the animation, and I must say that I'm pretty happy with my recreation of said GIF.  There are a host of improvements that I can already see when watching the webm video below.  Such as a better transition from the play button to pause button.  I'm also not super happy with my slider / time played section, it's too much of an abrupt change from half way to a zero point.  Oh well, I'll just take those lessons on my next project.
