## Prototype videos for SyFy Face/Off app

A couple of days ago I posted my quick ideas for a Face/Off app.  This app would actually be an app for all of SyFy's shows, and therefore the Face/Off portion would only be a small portion of said app.  Anyways, I spent the next handful of hours putting together my small prototype in Principle.  

My idea for this app is that when a user clicks on one of the episodes, any sections located above or below it, would slide away, and expand said episode section.  Here a user could watch the episode, read a recap of the episode, or just scroll and view the contestants make-ups for that episode.
<div class="prd_video_phone">
<video width="375" height="667" controls>
  <source src="/video/syfy/syfy_app1.webm" type="video/webm">
  <source src="/video/syfy/syfy_app1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
</div>

When a user clicked on the SyFy logo in the navigation bar, a modal would open up showing all of SyFy's shows that you could then page through and view their app section.  
<div class="prd_video_phone">
<video width="375" height="667" controls>
  <source src="/video/syfy/syfy_app2.webm" type="video/webm">
  <source src="/video/syfy/syfy_app2.mp4" type="video/mp4">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
</div>

This was just a quick prototype that I threw together, and so I can already see a million improvements that I could make to this.  However, I'll just leave it as is, and move onto the next thing.
