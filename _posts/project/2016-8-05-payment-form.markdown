## Taking Apart A Credit Card Form

After reading [Gabriel Tomescu's](https://blog.marvelapp.com/the-anatomy-of-a-credit-card-form-2/?utm_source=Marvel+Email+Updates&utm_campaign=ca48357c2a-Weekly_roundup_The_Anatomy_of_a_Credit_C8_2_2016&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_f0c2e2c157-ca48357c2a-427588773) great article on how he and his team at [Wave](https://www.waveapps.com/) dissected every piece of a credit card form, I just had to remake their design in Sketch, while adding some things of my own.  I think that trying to make a credit card form as painless as possible without having users drop off before completing a payment is an extremely hard task to take on.  However, the team at Wave made some great design choices, and hopefully they don't mind that I went and remade their UI from scratch, just so that I too could gain a better understanding of their design choices.

I made a few space changes to the form to give each input a little more breathing room, while also making the send screen much more visibly noticeable that a user is unable to modify any of the inputs that are filled.  Is it perfect?  No, of course not.  These are just changes that I've made without anyone to discuss things with, so I'm sure the form could be improved even further.

I made my [sketch file](https://www.dropbox.com/s/nn6zmsv33m3ss8s/CC%20Input%20Form.sketch?dl=0) available for anyone to download and take a look at.  I hope Wave doesn't mind that I re-made their UI, but by doing so, I've gained a much more deeper understanding of what makes a good credit card form into a great credit card form, and hopefully I can use that knowledge in the future.
